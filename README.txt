## Fixed Animation Player
The Fixed Animation Player is a Godot Engine script designed to work alongside your existing animation player. It allows seamless integration of animation files created by AnimationCompiler.gd into your project, utilizing the same UI and animations.

# Description
The purpose of FixedAnimationPlayer.gd is to serve as an enhanced version of the animation player. By placing this script alongside your old animation player, you can take advantage of the AnimationCompiler.gd to compile animations from the old player into the new one.

Please note that this public version of the Fixed Animation Player originates from my game, Dashwalk Dueling. While it should work well for most cases, it might require some adaptation or further customization depending on your specific project needs.

# Usage
Place the FixedAnimationPlayer.gd script alongside your existing animation player in your Godot project.
Use the AnimationCompiler.gd to compile animations from the old animation player into the new Fixed Animation Player. This way, both players can use the same UI and animation data.

# Forewarning
I want to be clear that I haven't put an extensive amount of effort into polishing this public version of the Fixed Animation Player, as it is derived from my game, Dashwalk Dueling. However, it should provide a useful starting point for your animation integration needs.

# Contribution
I welcome contributions and improvements from the community. If you make any enhancements to the Fixed Animation Player, please consider sharing them with the community through pull requests. While I may not actively work on this version, I am open to merging valuable updates that benefit the wider Godot community.
